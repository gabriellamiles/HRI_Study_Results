Study results for HRI module at UWE (2019)  - jupyter notebook kept here for reference. 

The Jupyter notebook (HRI_Analysis.ipynb) analyses a lot of graph combinations taking data from the files titled: "results_hri.csv" and "results_fin_sans_baseline.csv” these results files are edited versions of the file "results_fin.csv" which was taken directly from the Google questionnaire.
